aurorun - A jQuery plugin for automating interaction

DESCRIPTION

Autorun is a jQuery plugin developers can use to automate basic interaction with a jQuery-based site. The idea is to automate the mundane actions that need to be done every time you refresh the site you're working on. By automating this you free up valuable development time and keep your sanity.

INSTALLATION

Simply place the jquery.autorun.js somewhere in your project and include it in the HTML page you would like to automate. Don't forget to take it out again before deployment!

Please note that autorun only works on single pages, yet...

SIMPLE AUTOMATION EXAMPLE

Let's say we want to automate logging into a page, then clicking a button called "hitme":

$.autorun
    .type('#username', 'menno')
    .type('#password', 'hunter2')
    .submit('#loginform')
    .click('#hitme');

TODO

The one thing I'd still like to add to this tool is the ability to automate actions that move you from one page to the next like clicking links and submitting forms.
